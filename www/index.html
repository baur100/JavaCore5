<div> One of my favorite of all the <span class="mini">Collections </span> classes of Java is the HashMap.
    <span class="super">Its easy to use and easy to understand. HashMap is actually a hash table implementation of the Map
    interface. </span>The HashMap class is equivalent of HashTable only that the HashMap allows null values and keys.
    <span id="jowl" class="super">Moreover</span> hashmap is unsynchronized compared to HashTable. Since this is a lot faster because it is not
    synchronized however it would not be thread safe.

    In dealing with this class, always remember that the order of elements is changing over time.
    <span class="super"> In other words the placement of element on this pool of objects is dispersed.

    Now that we have described the HashMap letâ€™s take a look on a simple example.</span>
